                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm a computer science student studying at SPU. I'm set to graduate in June of 2025, and am looking forward to taking on a variety of opportunities.
                    Most of my work has been either designing complex systems from the ground-up, or extensively studying some individual topic to the point where I can build beyond the status quo. <br><br>

                    I began programming around 2011, but only recieved my formal education in it around 2017. Since then, I've written a lot of programs while trying to follow architectural, code quality, and security standards to a T. Most of my interests are based around the theory of computer science and high-level specifications for computing. I also especially enjoy learning about anything that's unfamiliar or unknown.<br><br>

                    My fundemental goal with programming is to design the most reliable, safe, and private systems that are theoretically and mathematically possible.

                    If you want to get my attention, the best way to do so is with email. Feel free to use <a class="about-link" href="mailto:veenstrak@spu.edu">veenstrak@spu.edu</a>, and I will do my best to get back to you within a week.<br><br>
                    All the projects I'm comfortable sharing are linked on my <a class="about-link" href="./projects.html">projects page</a>. If a project is mentioned, and there's no repository link, it's because I'm not ready to share the source code for one reason or another.<br>

                    <a class="about-link" href="https://www.eospace.com/">Eospace, Inc.</a> Computer Science Intern - August-October 2024<br>
                    <br>
                    During the Summer of 2024 I interned at Eospace, Inc. developing a Kafka library for internal inventory management. In my time as an intern, I created a C# library using Confluent and NuGet, maintained a development Kafka server, and developed a demonstration dynamically-generated WinForms application for entering in inventory information.
