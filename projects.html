                <p class="proj-p">
                    One of my favorite board games is dominion. 
                    In an effort to overdo a final class project, I decided to try and write the game in rust for <em>educational</em> purposes, using the terminal. <br><br>
                    I implemented about half of the cards in "First game," along with a CPU opponent that plays a simple strategy called "Big money" <br><br>
                    Considering the standards for this project was a terminal-style command interface, and I was working alone, I'm proud of the outcome. <br><br>

                <p class="proj-p">
                    This is my ongoing senior group-project to provide technical support and a mobile application for an engineering team's easy-lifting robot.<br><br>
                    I served as the scrummaster for a team of six during the first 3/4s of the project, and a backend developer for the last 1/4th. During the project, I got the chance to learn Android development, compose UI, Hilt dependency injection, the ROS package manager, and more.

                <p class="proj-p">
                    During my internship at <a link="https://www.eospace.com/" targe="_blank">Eospace, Inc</a>, I researched and created a producer/consumer library in C# using the Confluent library, as well as a Winforms Application that leveraged the producer side of my library. It was an interesting experience that involved managing a development server, developing with a C# library, and learning about Kafka's inner details.

                <p class="proj-p">
                    During my algorithms class, an extra credit assignment was to implement any complex algorithms discussed. <br>
                    I jumped on this as a challenge during the last day to see what I could get done in six hours, and was impressed with the results. <br>

                    Once the six hours were up, I had created python solutions for: <br> <br>
                    <ul class="proj-p pad-left">
                        <li>Interval Scheduling - Schedule the maximum number of tasks given a pipeline that can only take one task at a time?<br></li>
                        <li>Interval Scheduling - Schedule the maximum number of tasks given a pipeline that can only take one task at a time?<br></li>
                        <li>Closest Points - Given a random number of points at random positions, calculate the minnimum distance between all points. <br></li> 
                    </ul>

                <p class="proj-p">
                    Group project where me and a teammate created a graph using a large google dataset.
                    We were able to manually calculate several properties, including
                    centrality, distance, and a minnimum spanning tree.<br><br>

                    My role was implementing most of the fundemental algorithms, as well as researching the underlying Swing Java UI.

                <p class="proj-p">
                    This site was hand-built using CSS, HTML, and Javascript. I read the book "CSS in Depth" by Keith J. Grant, 
                    and learned a bunch about making sites, so now I have no excuse for writing bad ones.

                <p class="proj-p">
                    This is an abandoned personal game design project that tested the limits of how far I could push physics calculations and proper gravity handling.<br><br>
                    As the only programmer on this project, I wrote the entire player movement, physics, gravity, and rotation from scratch, so a player could move around a 2d sphere.<br><br>
                    This project made me familiar with cross-class signaling, modern application architecture, and some nuances of OpenGL and resolution handling.<br><br>
                    Godot isn't built for games that center around spherical coordinates without heavy modification, so the project is on hold until I can aquire some skills, and make a return.<br><br>
                    
                    This game also had a number of lovely art assets and animations done by someone who doesn't have a portfolio link, so I can't show off their art! :(
